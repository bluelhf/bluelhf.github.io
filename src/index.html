                    I'm a 16-year-old programming enthusiast and upper secondary education student living in Finland.
                    I spend most of my free time programming in — and drinking — Java. As I'm sure you've noticed, I've
                    kept this website small. My internet is quite slow so large sites often take a frustratingly long time
                    to load. Consider the small file size, then, a courtesy to others with similar or even slower internet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I currently have three computers, split between two households: One boasts 256 gibibytes of RAM and
                    a Quadro P6000, along with an Intel® Xeon® W-2145 CPU, which clocks in at 3.7 GHz. Needless to say, I'm very
                    lucky to have a setup as powerful as this, and it often comes in handy. The machine runs a dualboot of Pop!_OS
                    and Windows 11 Insider Preview, but I don't use the Windows side practically at all (hence why it's still in
                    the preview version of Windows 11), and I'm not very happy with Pop!_OS. I'm thinking of wiping it clean and
                    installing a systemd-less GNU+Linux distribution like Artix on it at some point.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My second computer is a little more modest, with 16 gibibytes of RAM, an NVIDIA® GeForce® RTX 2070, and an Intel®
                    Core™ i7-10700 with a base clock of 2.9 GHz.  This one is special in that it runs a development build of Devuan,
                    specifically Devuan Ceres, along with GNOME 42.2. It doesn't have fancy lights, or ridiculous amounts of RAM, or
                    a high base clock, or an absurd amount of cores, but it's a desktop, it's mine, and I'm proud of it and happy with it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My third computer is a small school laptop, a Dell Latitude 3310. It runs on an Intel® Core™ i3-8145U, with
                    a clock speed of 2.10 GHz. It has 8 gibibytes of RAM, and its GPU is the integrated Intel® UHD Graphics 620.
                    It runs Devuan Chimaera, GNOME, and Pop_Shell for tiling. I rarely use it outside of school, though, and I'll
                    have to return it when I leave anyways.
