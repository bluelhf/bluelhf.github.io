                I'm a 16-year-old programming enthusiast and upper secondary education student living in Finland.
                I spend most of my free time programming in — and drinking — Java. As I'm sure you've noticed, I've
                kept this website small. My internet is, to put it gently, !%☠#ing terrible, so large sites often take
                a frustratingly long amount of time to download. Consider the small file size, then, a courtesy to
                others with similar or even slower internet.
            </p>

                I currently have three computers that I use actively: One, at my mum's, boasts 256 gibibytes of RAM and
                a Quadro P6000, along with an Intel® Xeon® W-2145 CPU, which clocks in at 3.7 GHz. Needless to say, I'm very
                lucky to have a setup as powerful as this, and it often comes in handy. The machine runs a dualboot of Pop!_OS
                and Windows 11 Insider Preview, but I don't use the Windows side practically at all (hence why it's still in
                the preview version of Windows 11), and I'm not very happy with Pop!_OS. I'm thinking of wiping it clean and
                installing a systemd-less GNU+Linux distribution like Artix on it at some point.
